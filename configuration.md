# File server

## Configuration

A valid [JSON configuration file](./file_server.json) adheres to the following schema.

```JSON
{
	"directory": "./demo",
	"host_and_port": "127.0.0.1:4000",
	"content_encodings": ["gzip", "deflate", "br", "zstd"],
	"filepath_404s": [
		["./demo/404.gz", "gzip"],
		["./demo/404.html", null]
	]
}
```

The `content_encodings` and `filepath_404s` properties are optional.

### Run

Bash the following command to serve files based on a configuration:

```sh
file_server path/to/config.json
```

Open a browser and visit `http://localhost:4000`.

### Accept-Encoding

If an `accept-encoding` header is found in a request `file_server` will return a corresponding `gzip`-ed version of a requested file.

So if a request has:

```
Accept-Encoding: gzip;
```

And the target file has a correspponding gziped file: 

```sh
./www/index.html.gz		# serve gzip file if available
./www/index.html		# otherwise serve unencoded file
```

Then `file_server` will send the encoded file if available. Otherwise it serves the unencoded file.

### No dynamic encoding support

`File_server` does not encode or zip files ever.

This program serves static files. So you already got static files.

Just zip them up now. Why abuse cpu resoures for run time compression on static files? It don't make sense.

Go take a shower, stinky. Start that day over.

### Range requests

`File_server` supports range requests.

Multipart ranges are not currently supported because multipart ranges are a memory hog.

However, there are plans to add limited support with big restrictions on range sizes.
